# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Visualization-R-ggplot2-dplyr-
Exploratory Data Analysis using R, dplyr, and ggplot2 to identify trends and relationships in a dataset. Applied multiple visualization techniques to highlight insights. Evaluated data-driven problem-solving methods and proposed a justified solution.
Overview

This project applies techniques from the Foundations of Data Analysis course to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a complex dataset. The focus is on uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships among variables, while applying multiple visualization techniques to present findings effectively.

Objectives

Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis to identify trends and variable relationships.

Apply and evaluate data visualization techniques to enhance interpretability.

Compare and assess different problem-solving approaches for data-oriented challenges.

Develop and justify a practical solution to a problem discovered during EDA.

Tools & Techniques

R Programming: Data wrangling and analysis

dplyr & tidyr: Data manipulation

ggplot2: Data visualization

Quarto: Reproducible reporting
